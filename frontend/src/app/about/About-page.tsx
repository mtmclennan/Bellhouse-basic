          <h3>Our History</h3>
          <p>
            Bellhouse Excavating has been a trusted name in excavation and
            construction services since its establishment in 1982. Founded with
            a commitment to excellence and customer satisfaction, the company
            quickly gained a reputation for delivering high-quality workmanship
            and reliable service.

          <p>
            In 2020, Bellhouse Excavating underwent a significant change in
            management. Darryl, a long-time employee of the company and highly
            skilled in all areas of our services, took over management. With his
            in-depth knowledge and expertise, Darryl has continued the
            company&apos;s legacy of excellence, ensuring that Bellhouse
            Excavating remains a leader in the industry.
          </p>
